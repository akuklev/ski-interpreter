        <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of combinatory logic,
            a lovechild of lisp and brainfuck, developed by Moses Sch√∂nfinkel and Haskell Curry in the 1920s.</p>

        <p>A combinator is a one-argument function that accepts a one-argument function and
            returns a one-argument function.
            Everything here is a function - numbers, booleans, lists, and even free variables
            stand for functions we don't know how to compute just yet.</p>
        <p>The tradition is to depict the combinators as birds, and we won't be stepping too far away from it.</p>

        <h2>How computations work</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Given that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are combinators, then so is <code>x y</code>;
                if <code>z</code> is also a combinator, then <code>x y z</code> is calculated as <code>(x y) z</code>.
                <code>x y z</code>, <code>x(y)(z)</code>, <code>(x y)(z)</code>, <code>(x(y))(z)</code>
                are all the same thing.
                <code>x (y z)</code>, however, is <i>not</i> the same as <code>(x y) z</code>
                (at least not for arbitrary terms).
            </li>

            <li>
                If a <i>reduction rule</i> is known for the <i>leftmost</i> term in an (sub-)expression, it is applied.
                Reduction rules are given in the form of "<code>X a b c = b (c a)</code>"
                and are interpreted as follows:
                <code>X a</code> returns a function <code>f1</code> such that
                <code>f1 b</code> returns a function <code>f2</code> such that
                <code>f2 c</code> returns expression <code>b (c a)</code>.
                This technique is known as currying.
            </li>

            <li>
                A computation terminates when no more reductions can be made.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>With a right set of initial terms this is enough for Turing completeness,
            and at least one such set exists, as we'll see shortly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
        <h2>On the notation</h2>
        <p>On the notation: we'll be typically using single capital letters for common combinators,
            lowercase letters for free variables, and lowercase <i>words</i> for compound expressions.
            Uppercase letters can be lumped together and lowercase terms must be separated with spaces. </p>

        <p>E.g. <code>CBx foo (y z) (SII)</code> - here only <code>C</code> and <code>S</code>
            are reduction candidates</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
        <h2>The S, K, I basis</h2>

        <p>
            <code>I</code>, the Ibis, or Identity, has a very simple reduction rule:
            for any term <code>x</code>, <code>I x = x</code>.
            Thus <code>IIx</code>, <code>I(II)x</code>, <code>II(Ix)</code> and so on all converge to <code>x</code>.
            Note, however, that <code>x I</code> does not equal <code>x</code>
            and <code>x I y</code> does not equal <code>x y</code>.</p>

        <p>
            K, the Kestrel, or Konstant, is defined as <code>K x y = x</code>.
            Here's where currying happens for real:
            K x returns a function which in turn discards its argument and returns x and nothing else.
            Note again that <code>x K y z</code> does not become <code>x y</code> because <code>K</code>
            is not in the first place and the reduction rule is not applicable.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code>S</code>, the Starling, adheres <code>S f g x = f x (g x)</code>.
            That is, given two functions and an argument (which is also a function given the setup,
            but it's not important here), it applies both functions to the argument and fuses the results together.
        </p>

        <h2>Connection to lambda calculus</h2>

        <p>An arbitrary lambda expression can be converted to SKI via the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lambda; x . x</code> becomes <code>I</code>;</li>
            <li><code>&lambda; x . f(x)</code> (where f is independent of x) becomes <code>f</code>;</li>
            <li><code>&lambda; x . y</code> (where y does not depend on x) becomes <code>K y</code>;</li>
            <li><code>&lambda; x . y(z)</code> becomes <code>S(&lambda; x . y)(&lambda; x . z)</code>,
                where <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> may or may not depend on <code>x</code>.
            </li>
            <li>The process is repeated from the innermost lambda expression outwards and
                is guaranteed to terminate. <i>(proof?..)</i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            As a matter of fact, <code>I</code> can be derived from <code>S</code> and <code>K</code>
            and those two thus form a basis together.
