=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dear future maintainer!
I'm sorry for this island of barely readable garbage in this repo.

What this file does is replaces all occurances of

    "id": ""

with

    "id": "(10 bytes of random base62)"

within json files under /docs/quest-data/ directory. 

This felt less ugly than random UUIDs at the time of this writing.
